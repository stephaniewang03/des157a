            <p>I will be updating my Game On project, a battle that is currently in the initial stages. However, I have plans to improve the game's functionality by adding interesting features.</p>

            <p>I plan on improving the functionality by incorporating character selection among multiple playable characters, and the other opponent will be random. The character selection will be its own separate page, and users will be able to select the character similar to the UI for Street Fighter. Each pairing of characters in the battle could also trigger specific dialogues to add narrative to character dynamics. Meanwhile, each attack will trigger random dialogues from a set of dialogues. I will also try to add sound effects and hopefully background music to make the game more interesting. Besides functionality, I will also improve visuals as a second priority.</p>
                
            <p>I might share my ideas about functionality and get feedback from developers on my project team in Codelab or my dad who's an industry professional.</p>
