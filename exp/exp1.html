        /*my program prints all numbers from 1 to 100 except when it's divisible by 3 or 5. For numbers divisible by 5, it prints Buzz. For numbers divisible by 3, it prints Fizz. When the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, Buzz will be printed, because it's the first condition that's checked in the order. For loop, it begins from 1 and ends at 100 which is <101. ++ in i++ adds 1 to the operand.*/
