                <p>This image is interesting because my dog Rocky is forced to go into the sun in our backyard to get some vitamin D, since he sleeps in the house all day every day. Rocky doesn't like to move around or exercise much around the house so he had a really bored expression. The sun was also too bright for him, so he was squinting with a funny expression. This image relates to the topic of my archive since it's about daily life through my dog's eyes, so the captions will be from Rocky's perspective. I think my archive will show how close I am with my dog and how I try to connect with him and see things from his perspective, capturing every special moment as much as I can.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This is an image of a street with a white car in the center on a cloudy day from Michelle. The car is behind the bushes and tree of the island on the other side of the street. The tall and packed bushes makes it seem as if the car is buried within the bushes. The car seems still and stranded rather than in motion or waiting for the lights, since it's in the middle of the road with no car in front or behind it in view. The cloudy weather that looks like it's about to rain and the leaning trees also add to the chilly atmosphere and oddness of the car seemingly buried in the bushes in the center. It's also mysterious how there's no other cars in view when the car is situated in the middle of the street, but the angle and depth of the image may also create an illusion about the real context behind it.</p>
